# S&P 500 Stock Analysis with Spark

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs a descriptive analysis of S&P 500 stock data using Apache Spark. The analysis covers various aspects of the stock market, including stock performance, trading volumes, and volatility.

## Overview

In this notebook, we explore the following aspects of the S&P 500 stock data:

- **Data Loading**: We use Apache Spark to load the S&P 500 stock data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

- **Data Exploration**: We conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. This includes examining summary statistics and visualizing trends.

- **Stock Specific Analysis**: We answer specific questions about individual stocks, such as Apple (AAPL), including the highest stock price, trading volumes, and more.

- **Market-Wide Analysis**: We analyze the entire dataset to determine the frequency of days where closing prices are higher than opening prices, the most traded stock, the least traded stock, and more.
